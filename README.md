# LoLView - League of Legends Teammate Lookup

## Introduction
Are you tired of your League of Legends ranked games ending in champion select?
Your team combination is good but some of your teammates are off-role,
trolling, or tilted. Subsequently, you lose the game and never had a chance.
LolView is aiming to help you make better decisions on whether to keep the teammates
you are matched up with.
LoLView is an application that, when launched, will monitor your LoL client
while you are in Champion Select. LoLView will grab all of your current 
Teammates and search up their stats against the League of Legends API to give
you more insight as to who your teammates are.
